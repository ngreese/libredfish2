## Introduction

This library crate is a continuation of the work that the contributers of [libredfish](https://github.com/cholcombe973/libredfish) started.

The initial version was a fork of their repository and all content that is equivalent is attributed to them.

This library serves as an interface to DTMF's Redfish standard for enterprise hardware.

## Redfish

All content of this library follows the Redfish Specification, detailed at [their website](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/redfish)
